# Bridges Website 1

Created a dynamic website to host university-related articles in the form of PDFs for students.

# Getting Started:

Use `git clone` to download the project. Then `cd` into the folder and open it on VScode (run `code .`). Once you're within the text editor, open up a terminal and run 'python3 manage.py runserver' to boot up the server. Then go to the location provided (probably something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

# Built With:

The project was built using Django (Python), HTML, CSS and Javascript.
